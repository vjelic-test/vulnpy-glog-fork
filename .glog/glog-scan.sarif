In Python, this vulnerability can occur when using the `os.system()` function, which executes a shell command from a Python script. If the command string includes unsanitized user input, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using `os.system()` or similar functions that execute shell commands. If it's necessary to use such functions, ensure that the command string does not include any unsanitized user input. Instead, use safer alternatives like `subprocess.run()` or `os.execv()`, which do not invoke a shell and thus are not susceptible to shell injection attacks.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of:\n\n```python\nimport os\nreturn os.system(command)\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nreturn subprocess.run(command, shell=False, check=True)\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the built-in Python library `subprocess`.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Command Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection)\n- [CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)"

This is due to the fact that the function deserializes YAML data which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary Python commands.\n\nThe `yaml.load_all(user_input, Loader=yaml.UnsafeLoader)` is a sink for this vulnerability as it uses the `UnsafeLoader` which can create any Python object, which can be a security risk if you receive a YAML document from an untrusted source such as the Internet.

It arises when the SHA1 hashing algorithm is used with the `usedforsecurity=False` setting. SHA1 is considered weak due to known vulnerabilities and is not recommended for cryptographic security. Using SHA1 for security-sensitive operations can lead to a variety of security issues, such as collision attacks, where two different inputs produce the same hash.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a stronger hashing algorithm such as SHA256, SHA3, or BLAKE2. These algorithms are currently considered secure and are not known to have any significant vulnerabilities. \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the use of SHA1 with a stronger hashing algorithm. For example, you can replace:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nh = hashlib.new(\"SHA1\")\n```\n\nwith:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nh = hashlib.new(\"SHA256\")\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the `hashlib` library, which is included in the Python Standard Library.\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\n\"Exec Usage Detected\" is a vulnerability in Python programming language that arises when the `exec()` function is used. The `exec()` function is a built-in Python function that executes the Python code, which is passed as an argument. If the argument passed to the `exec()` function is not sanitized properly, it can lead to code injection attacks. This is because the `exec()` function executes the argument as a Python code, which can be manipulated by an attacker to execute malicious code.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nAvoid using the `exec()` function whenever possible. If it's necessary to use `exec()`, ensure that the argument passed to `exec()` is sanitized properly. This means that any user-supplied input should be checked to ensure that it does not contain any malicious code. \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of using `exec()`, consider using safer alternatives like `ast.literal_eval()`. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport ast\n\n# Instead of this:\n# exec(code)\n\n# Do this:\nast.literal_eval(code)\n```\n\nIn this example, `ast.literal_eval()` safely parses and evaluates an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display. It's safer than `exec()` because it does not support arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example does not require any external library dependencies. The `ast` module is part of the Python Standard Library.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)"
